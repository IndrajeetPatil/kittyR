# Raison d’être <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" width="360" />

This package is designed for rainy days when your results are heartbreaking or
when no matter what you try, you can't seem to get rid of that bug. Take a
respite from those negative thoughts by accessing kitty pics **and** their
adorable meows right from your R console `r emo::ji("heart_eyes_cat")` and then
get back to work again!

# Installation

You can get the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("IndrajeetPatil/kittyR")
```

```{r include = FALSE}
library(kittyR)
```

# Functions

There are only two available functions in this package-

In case you want a picture of a kitty:

```{r kittyR1}
# to always have the same kitty on README
set.seed(123)

# show me the kitty NOW!
kittyR::kittyR()
```

By default, the collection will include any kind of cat (big, small, wild,
etc.). If you want only kittens, you can use an additional argument.

```{r kittyR2}
# to always have the same kitty on README
set.seed(14)

# show me the kitten NOW!
kittyR::kittyR(meow = FALSE, only_kitten = TRUE)
```

The collection of cat pictures comes from the following collections of freely
available images:

  - <https://unsplash.com/s/photos/cat/>
  - <https://www.reshot.com/search/cat/>
  - <https://unsplash.com/s/photos/kitten/>
  - <https://www.reshot.com/search/kitten/>

In case you just want to hear a meow either *apropos* nothing or at the end of
execution of some code to let you know that the execution is complete, just
include this line of code:

```{r meowR}
# can't print the sound, so
# meow meow meow
# you can choose from a sample of sounds included in the package
kittyR::meowR(sound = 4)
```

If you have a kitty meow that you like and would like to include in the package,
please either make a PR or e-mail it to me and I will include it.

This package was inspired by [pupR](https://github.com/melissanjohnson/pupR)
package by Melissa Innerst.

May these kitties bring some joy and amusement during your stressful data
digging jobs!
